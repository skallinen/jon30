- making sampling quicker
  - support weighting

- surface with and without real data

- generalize code (centering, scaling, etc.)

- credible intervals for the surface

- polars with credible intervals

- measuring the delta between surfaces, credibles intervals, etc. (lost opportunities / error in the theoretical model)

- view of credible intervals in real time

- REPL experience videos

- ggplot-like styling for the scatter3d

- improving the model (splines, etc.)

- animation

- Bayesian updating with PyMC
